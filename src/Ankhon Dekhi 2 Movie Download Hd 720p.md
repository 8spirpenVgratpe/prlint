Peter Jackson's movie adaptions of The Lord of the Rings are not faithful to the original books in every aspect. He made some changes to the events, timelines, and geographic distances to fit the cinematic format and his artistic vision. Most of the major events from the books are still present in the movies, but some of them are different in terms of how, when, or where they happen. Some of the events and details that appear in the movies are not based on the books at all, but are added by Jackson and his team.[13]

Some of the changes that Jackson made to The Lord of the Rings movies are minor and do not affect the overall plot or themes of the story. For example, he changed the appearance of some characters, such as Arwen, Legolas, and Gimli, to make them more appealing or distinctive. He also added some scenes that were not in the books, such as the prologue that shows the history of the One Ring, or the flashbacks that show Gandalf's encounter with the Balrog.
  
However, some of the changes that Jackson made are more significant and have a bigger impact on the story and the characters. For example, he omitted some characters and events that were important in the books, such as Tom Bombadil, Glorfindel, and the Scouring of the Shire. He also altered some characters' personalities and motivations, such as Faramir, Denethor, and Frodo. He also changed some of the events and outcomes of the battles, such as Helm's Deep, Minas Tirith, and the Black Gate.
  
These changes have been controversial among fans and critics of The Lord of the Rings. Some people appreciate Jackson's creative choices and think that they make the movies more exciting and engaging. Others dislike Jackson's changes and think that they betray the spirit and message of the books. Regardless of one's opinion, it is undeniable that Jackson's movies are different from the books in many ways.[13]
